# Import-Hash-Comparison
The provided script is an import hash (imphash) comparison tool designed for malware analysts. Import hash comparison is a technique used to identify similarities and potential relationships between different Portable Executable (PE) files, which are commonly used for Windows executables, DLLs, and other binary files. The imphash is a hash value calculated based on the imported functions and their ordering within a PE file's import table.

# Tool Purpose:
The primary purpose of this tool is to analyze a collection of PE files, typically associated with malware analysis, and identify files that share the same import hash. Similar import hashes often indicate potential code reuse or relationships between different files.

# Key Features:

Batch Processing: The tool processes all files within a specified folder and its subfolders, making it efficient for simultaneously analyzing a large number of samples.
Error Handling: It includes error handling to gracefully handle cases where a file cannot be processed, displaying an error message but continuing to process other files.
Hash Comparison: It calculates each PE file's import hash (imphash) and compares the hashes to identify potential duplicates or files with shared characteristics.
Hash Collision Detection: If two or more files have the same import hash, it reports a "Hash collision," indicating that these files have similar imported functions.

# How to Use:
To use the tool, you would typically follow these steps:
1. Save the script to a file, for example, compare_hashes.py.
2. Run the script from the command line, providing the path to the folder containing the PE files you want to analyze as an argument. For example:
3. python3 compare_hashes.py MalwareFolder
The script will recursively traverse the specified folder and calculate the import hash for each PE file it encounters.

If it finds any files with the same import hash (hash collision), it will display a message indicating which files share the same imphash.

# Use Cases:

Malware Analysis: Malware analysts can use this tool to quickly identify similarities between different malware samples based on their import hashes, potentially revealing connections between various malicious files.
Threat Intelligence: Security professionals and threat analysts can use this tool to analyze and compare PE files to uncover relationships between different threats or campaigns in their threat intelligence research.
